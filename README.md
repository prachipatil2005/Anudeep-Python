## Scripts Description

### 1. `gitignore`
A configuration file specifying which files and directories should be ignored by Git. It typically includes temporary files, log files, compiled code, and other unnecessary files that should not be tracked by version control.

### 2. `addition.py`
A Python script that performs the addition of two or more numbers. It demonstrates basic arithmetic operations and how to use user input in Python.

### 3. `area_triangle.py`
A Python script that calculates the area of a triangle based on its base and height. This script provides an easy way to understand the use of simple formulas in Python.

### 4. `even_odd_temary.py`
A Python script that checks if a given number is even or odd using a ternary operator, providing a concise and efficient way to evaluate the condition.

### 5. `function.py`
Contains various function definitions for basic tasks or operations. It is intended to demonstrate how to define and use functions in Python.

### 6. `hotelSystemUpdated.py`
A Python script for managing hotel system operations such as bookings, check-ins, and room assignments. It helps demonstrate the concept of basic management systems using Python.

### 7. `kilometer_miles.py`
A Python script that allows conversion between kilometers and miles. This script demonstrates simple unit conversion, which can be useful in many real-world applications.

### 8. `lambda.py`
A Python script that demonstrates the use of lambda functions. Lambda functions are anonymous functions in Python, typically used for short operations that are simple and quick.

### 9. `lower_function.py`
A Python script that defines a function to convert a given string of text to lowercase. This demonstrates string manipulation and function creation in Python.

### 10. `min_max_function.py`
A Python script that finds the minimum and maximum values in a list. This script is useful for understanding list operations and working with Pythonâ€™s built-in functions.

### 11. `odd_numbers.py`
A Python script that generates a list of odd numbers or checks if a number is odd. It can be modified to work with different sequences or number ranges.

### 12. `simple_interest.py`
A Python script that calculates simple interest based on principal, rate, and time. This script can be applied to basic finance-related tasks and demonstrates arithmetic calculations.

### 13. `smart_study_mate_poster(2).p`
An image or poster related to a "smart study mate" concept, potentially visualizing the idea of an educational tool or study aid.

### 14. `square_function.py`
A Python script that defines a function to compute the square of a given number. This demonstrates simple mathematical operations and function definitions.

### 15. `swap_numbers.py`
A Python script that swaps two numbers using various techniques. This script helps in understanding variable assignments and basic algorithm logic.

### 16. `tempCodeRunnerfile.py`
A temporary file used by code editors like VSCode when running Python scripts. It is not intended for use in the final project and can be deleted after testing.

### 17. `temperature.py`
A Python script that converts temperature between different units, such as Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. It demonstrates basic conversion operations and user input handling.

### 18. `ternary.py`
A Python script demonstrating the ternary operator, which is a concise way to evaluate simple conditional expressions. This operator provides a shorthand for `if-else` conditions.

### 19. `time_greet.py`
A Python script that greets the user based on the time of day (morning, afternoon, evening). It uses conditional statements and time handling to provide dynamic greetings.

### 20. `total_meal_cost.py`
A Python script that calculates the total cost of a meal, including tax and tip. This is useful for understanding percentage-based calculations and user input.

### 21. `trial.py`
A test or experimental script used to try out different concepts, libraries, or features. It is often used for testing code snippets before incorporating them into larger projects.

### 22. `user_details.py`
A Python script to manage user details, such as name, age, and other personal information. It can be extended to store data in files or databases, demonstrating basic data management.
