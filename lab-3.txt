Q.1)Using input() function take one number from the user and using ternary operators,check whether the number is even or odd.

number1 = int(input("enter the number:"))
# Using ternary operator to check if the number is even or odd

result = "The number is Even" if number1 % 2 == 0 else "The number is odd"
print(result)

Q.2)Using input function take two number and then swap the number.

#Input from the user
num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
# Swapping the numbers

num1,num2=num2,num1
print(f"after swapping first Number={num1} and second number={num2}")

Q.3)Write a Program to Convert Kilometers to Miles.

#Input from the user
kilometers = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
# Conversion from kilometers to miles

miles = kilometers * 0.621
print(f"{kilometers} kilometers is equal to {miles} miles.")

Q.4)Find the Simple Interest on Rs. 200 for 5 years at 5% per year.

# Given values
principal = 200  # Principal amount
time = 5  # Time period
rate = 5  # Rate of interest

# Calculate Simple Interest
simple_interest = (principal * rate * time) / 100

print( f"The Simple Interest on Rs. 200 for 5 years at 5% per year is Rs. {simple_interest}.")
